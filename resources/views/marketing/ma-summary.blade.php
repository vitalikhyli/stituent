			Re: A complete constituent service solution for the MA House
		</div>
		<div class="py-4">
			Dear Mr. Speaker: 
		</div>
		<div class="py-4">
			Constituent service has become even more essential during the COVID crisis. Legislators, particularly at the Representative level, are a primary link between people and their state government at a time when livelihoods and public health are at stake.
		</div>
		<div class="py-4">
			Community Fluency is a Massachusetts-based suite of online tools designed to simplify constituent service. We make constituent service fast and accessible, allowing elected officials and their staff to better serve their district from at home or in the building. Our company has been in the building for 15 years, and our experienced staff has spent over 20 years in the MA House as legislative staffers.
		</div>
		<div class="py-4">
			As the need for organized and thorough constituent service tools rises, we have expanded. <b>We currently serve over 30 members</b> (~20%) in your chamber. They have chosen to trust us and invest their personal money in the best constituent service tools available.
		</div>

		<div class="py-4">
			We ask for the opportunity to meet with your office, to show you the tools we offer, and to hear from your own members on how our system helps them serve their district. Our proposal, detailed on the next page, outlines our goal of providing the service (along with support & training) to every one of your members and their staff.
