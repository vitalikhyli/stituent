			<span class="font-normal">Community Fluency</span> Terms of Service
		</div>
		<div class="mt-4">

			<div class="text-base leading-6 text-gray-700">

		    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mt-4"></h3>
		    <p class="pb-3">By downloading and using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. The Community Fluency Companion App is not a stand-alone service. This app is only available to subscribed members of Community Fluency and their approved staff and users.</p>
		    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mt-4">Use Only as Intended</h3>
		    <p class="pb-3">Community Fluency and the Community Fluency Companion App are meant to be used for assisting official offices with constituent service. These offices could be of an elected official, a municipal official, a University official, or other approved entity and their approved staff. Community Fluency staff will approve all accounts before allowing access. Once granted access, the app may not be used for personal, marketing purposes or any other purpose besides assisting in an official capacity. All usage is logged (see <a class="text-blue font-bold" href="/privacy">privacy policy</a>), and use of the app for anything besides the purpose outlined by the official capacity will violate the terms of service.</p>
		    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mt-4">Intellectual Property</h3>
		    <p class="pb-3">You’re not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Fluency Software.</p>
		    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mt-4">Changes and Updates</h3>
		    <p class="pb-3">Fluency Software is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p>
		    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mt-4">Personal Phone Security</h3>
		    <p class="pb-3">The Community Fluency app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Community Fluency app won’t work properly or at all.</p>

		    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mt-4">Wi-Fi and Internet Access</h3>
		    <p class="pb-3">Community Fluency requires access to the internet. We do not store you data on the phone, we access it from our secure servers via https encrypted protocol. You should be aware that there are certain things that Fluency Software will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but Fluency Software cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.</p>
			<h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mt-4"></h3>
			<p class="pb-3">If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p>
			<h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mt-4"></h3>
			<p class="pb-3">We will do our best to make sure it is functional and complete, but we offer the service of the Companion App as-is and make no guarantees that it will always be fully functional.</p>
			<h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mt-4">Third-Party Services</h3>
			<p class="pb-3">With respect to Fluency Software’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Fluency Software accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>
			<h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mt-4">Android and iOS Updates</h3>
			<p class="pb-3">At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android & iOS – the requirements for the both systems(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Fluency Software does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android & iOS version that you have in your device.</p>
			<h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mt-4"></h3>
			<p class="pb-3">However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</p>

			<h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mt-4">Terms & Privacy</h3>

			<p class="pb-3">
			Your constituent service and campaign data is private to your office. Community Fluency does not sell or expose your private data to any third-party vendors or entities, including Stripe. To see more of our privacy policy, click <a class="text-blue font-bold" href="/privacy">here</a>.

			<h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mt-4">Reselling Data</h3>
